Collection of files for a default Hive System project

defaultproject.hivemap: hivemap controlling the main logic, opened and edited with HiveGUI

defaultproject*.py: main Python script that loads and runs the defaultproject.hivemap
 defaultproject.py: 
  runs the hivemap inside the consolehive, providing support for keypresses 
   from the terminal/shell
 defaultproject-blender.py: 
  runs the hivemap inside the Blender Game Engine (BGE)
 defaultproject-panda.py: 
  runs the hivemap inside Panda3D  
defaultproject.blend: Blender file that runs defaultproject-blender.py when the BGE starts

hivegui.conf: HiveGUI configuration file, telling HiveGUI to look for resources 
 in the directories below:

hivemaps/ : 
 Put here the hivemaps that are embedded inside the main hivemap
workermaps/:
 Here you can create workermaps for custom workers, using WorkerGUI.
 Use the "Generate" button inside WorkerGUI to generate the Python source code
  for your worker, and put that code inside the workers/ directory
workers/ : 
 Put here Python code of your workers, coded manually or generated by WorkerGUI.
 Drones are also detected when their Python source code is put here
spydermaps/:
 Put here spydermaps that configure your hive, using SpyderGUI
 Spydermaps derive from a parent spyderhive: 
  in SpyderGUI, choose one of the default ones, or code your own in spyderhives/
spyderhives/ :
 If you want to code your own spyderhives, put the Python code here.
spydermodels/ :
 Put here custom Spyder data models (.spy files), 
  for use inside SpyderGUI and/or HiveGUI
 Don't forget to adapt __init__.py to import the .spy file!
